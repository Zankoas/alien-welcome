--- CLASSIFICATION UNKNOWN: ASSIGNMENT ICARUS ---


Marine,


Excuse the additional precautions taken to get this message to you. They were deemed necessary given my new station. Events moved quickly following Operation Octopus Garden and not always as I hoped.

Taking out General Vaughn was the right choice, but it was a pyrrhic victory.

You have my word that Steel, Calliope, Stitch, Gunny, and Knives received the full funerals they deserved. A true marine's funeral.

Cutter also recived an offical funeral.

Grim was given a posthumous dishonourable discharge, as much as that bastard deserves.

At this time I am unable on comment on Wolf, Patch, or Dorian.

Now I need a team I can trust. This op is important but strictly off the record. One weekend, in and out. No central funding: you will need to provide your own transport and rations. Appropriate outfits will be required and again you will need to provide your own.

To those who have served under me before, you know my ethos, you know my standards. To those who haven’t, I repeat my immortal words of guidance:

I demand the best. You will give me your all or you will die. You may well die anyway. But I offer you the chance to do real good: to serve the real interests of the people of this great nation.

You have have 240 hours to make the right choice.


- Colonel ‘Mac’ Hanrahan
