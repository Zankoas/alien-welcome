--- USCM CLASSIFIED BRIEFING: OPERATION ARCTURIAN APOCALYPSE ---


We’ve got a hot one marines; let us see what you can do under real pressure.

The main settlement on Arcturus has been seized by xenophobic bioterrorists called the Children of the Two Divines. These extremists are led by this crackpot - Jannes Ruedi. Intel says they intend to wipe out Arcturian culture by destroying their art and relics. Their ship made a low approach over the planetside Trading Outpost and dropped a drum of QTC on the USCMC station - killing 27 of our own.

At last report they’ve massacred over 240 Arcturians and humans at the planet’s cultural centre, the Grand Kivas. They’ve flooded the area with CN-20 nerve gas and taken three dozen locals hostage as shields. On top of that, we think they have a nuke.

Get in there, free the hostages, take Jannes and his top lieutenants alive for interrogation, and secure any surviving relics for protection. We need to keep civilian casualties at an absolute minimum - the politics surrounding Arcturus are… sensitive. We just can’t have the shit hitting the fan here.

One of the hostages is a Geholgod Institute brain - Tejal Ahluwalia. Apparently, she’s connected to a UAAC special project division. We want all the hostages to come home but protecting her and whatever sensitive data she carries is paramount. Don’t screw this up marines - I want to know what the fuck she was cooking up.

As soon as you have the hostages free and the nuke locked down, call it in. We’ll have two squads and four dropships standing by to evac the civis and secure the whole site.
