--- USCM CLASSIFIED BRIEFING: OPERATION DREAMCATCHER ---


We’ll be heading into deep-space for this one marines. Remember your cryo training and you’ll wake up right as rain. Keep the oxygen mask attached. Don’t breathe in the coolant. Try to relax. Emergency eject is at the top if you need it. Don’t take anything in with you but your sleep-wear.

There is some top of the line gear waiting for us out there, it will be worth the journey I promise.


- Colonel ‘Mac’ Hanrahan
