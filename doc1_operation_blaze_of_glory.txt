--- USCM CLASSIFIED BRIEFING: OPERATION BLAZE OF GLORY ---


You have been invited to join Marine Assault Unit 141. I don’t know what you may have heard of my unit, but allow me to set the record straight. I’ll teach you some history along the way too. The United States is the best damn nation in the best damn federation in the world. Period. That said, while fusing a dozen nations together into an intergalactic superpower solves a lot of problems, it doesn’t solve bureaucracy.

We had enough pencil-pushing suit-wearing consultant-paying cowards before the merger, and we haven’t got less now. The United American Allied Command, the Canadian Colonial Armed Forces, the Outer Rim Defence Fleet, they’re all full of them. Even with the beloved Colonial Marines the President needs two dozen forms to get anything done. That’s why I created Marine Assault Unit 141.

Marine Assault Unit 141 isn’t part of any other organisation. You report to me. I report directly to the President. No bullshit. We get shit done. If you are tired of getting denigrated by politics, being pushed around by corporate interests, spinning your wheels waiting on ineffective leadership, I offer you the chance to do real good: to serve the real interests of the people of this great nation.

My expectations for this unit are sky high. I demand the best. You will give me your all or you will die. You may well die anyway. But I will treat you with dignity, you will get the best gear, full operational autonomy, top notch intel.

If you are willing, I have direct presidential authority to release you from any and all obligations to enable you to join Marine Assault Unit 141 as soon as is feasible. I look forward to hearing from you.


- Colonel ‘Mac’ Hanrahan
