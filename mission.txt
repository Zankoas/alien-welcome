--- USCM CLASSIFIED BRIEFING: OPERATION ICARUS ---


Marine,


Please excuse the additional precautions necessary to get this message to you. Events moved quickly following Operation Octopus Garden and not always as I hoped.

Let me clear though, taking out General Vaughn was the right choice, if nonetheless a pyrrhic victory.

You have my word that Steel, Calliope, Stitch, Gunny, and Knives got the marine funerals they deserved.

It is with mixed feeling I confess that I must play politics now, and so Cutter was also given a full military funeral. It is, however, without mixed feelings that I can confirm Grim was given a posthumous dishonourable discharge. The bastard.

At this time I am unable on comment on Wolf, Patch, or Dorian.

To those who have served under me before, you know my ethos, you know my standards. To those who haven’t, I repeat my immortal words of guidance:

-	I demand the best. You will give me your all or you will die. You may well die anyway. But I offer you the chance to do real good: to serve the real interests of the people of this great nation.

Now I need a team I can trust. This op is important, but strictly off the record. One weekend, in and out. No central funding, you’ll need to provide you own transport and rations. Appropriate outfits will also be required and, again, you’ll need to provide your own.

I look forward to hearing from you.


     - Colonel ‘Mac’ Hanrahan
