--- USCM CLASSIFIED BRIEFING: OPERATION QUIET CATCH ---


Thanks in no small part to your stellar performance in the last mission we’ve got the president's ear, and I’ve put that great asset to immediate use. Last night I was briefed on a UPP black site gone wrong, and thanks to that early warning we will be the first ship to reach the site.

We will be going behind enemy lines; by the time you read this we will be in UPP territory. We only have a small window before UPP reinforcements, USCMC goons, whoever else likes top level military secrets turns up.

Reports suggest the Corinth Colony on planet KOI-751.02 has become the victim of their own bioweapons experiment. We aren’t sure what the hell they were making, only that it went to hell. All we know is Corinth is in a bad way and whatever caused it was developed at the Norcomm Ouragan Testing Facility about 100 klicks outside of the colony proper. Intel says Ouragan itself is dead, so you kids get to go in with CBRN gear, scout the area, download their computer core, and collect samples of what they were working on. Move carefully but quickly.

Once again our generous corporate companions have kindly sent us someone to take along; a biodefense virologist named Dr. Nl Babak. He’s a big deal smart guy, so do me a favour and bring him home in one piece, understood?

Oh and one more thing marines, I’ve got a present for you when you wake up. Don’t get used to it.


- Colonel ‘Mac’ Hanrahan
