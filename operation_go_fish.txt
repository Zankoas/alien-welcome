--- USCM CLASSIFIED BRIEFING: OPERATION GO FISH ---


Marines, you are still FTL. You will not be returning to your freezers. Events have escalated dramatically while you’ve been getting your beauty sleep. Anesidora Colony is under direct UPP attack, and I need you ready to hot drop ASAP.

Our boys down there are taking one hell of a beating but your mission is specific: we are missing two code breakers from the Geholgod Institute - Doctors Deol Chawla and Velma Liu. Their work is vital to operations across the Borderline Region. Last week, the docs packed up their work and shook their handlers for reasons unknown. General Vaughn tracked them to Adagia before losing the trail, and opted to hide this information until the Union boys launched their assault and started sweeping the island for them.

We’ll rendezvous with the USS Heinlein and the USS Tunku Allang in orbit. Heinlein’s got EVACs and troops spread across Adagia to push back the UPP. Tunku Allang’s got Spec Ops combing the beaches for our eggheads. Word is they are the same set of black glad freaks who went after you on Arcturus.

The colony’s being evacuated out of the island’s only spaceport - Morgan’s Bluff. MU/TH/UR says there’s a high probability the docs are going there, so that’s where I’m sending you. The spaceport is an easy target for long range fire, so put up a PB Phalanx to shoot down incoming bullshit. The Spec Ops are also there - bitchin’ about wading ass-deep through 1600 evacuees. Do better than them. Don’t let our codebreakers board just any transport and disappear. Secure ‘em and their work. Hold Morgan's until we can extract you. I want you ready for launch as soon as we go sublight.


- Colonel ‘Mac’ Hanrahan
